# Overview

In this program I focused on learning and understanding Rust code, specifically IO file reading and writing. I also learned about ownership and passing and tried to avoid while loops instead opting in for recursive calls.

This program reads in a text file as a string, converts it to a char vector before using a recursive function which utilizes a HashMap to learn how many time s a letter is used inside the file. It allows for the user to determine whether they would also like to count punctuation as well.

The purpose in writing this piece of software was to learn and cement basic syntax and programming methodologies found within rust.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write and test the program.

Rust language

# Useful Websites

- [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org)

# Future Work

- Use Cargo for better project file structure and management.
- Implement a user input for the file directory.
- Output data in a better format such as JSON.
