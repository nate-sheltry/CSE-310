# Overview

This module is focused on learning a more functional perspective, in this specific instance, Erlang has no direct form of iteration so it was about implementing recursion and alternatives to iterative programming, while learning how to manipulate and transfer data without using traditional objects.

This program will scan a directory, find the files with their file type within it and then ask the user which file type they are looking for.

This program handles lists, maps, and finding alternatives to iterative work flows via Erlang's functional approach. As such my purpose was to become acquainted better with non-iterative work flows, understand a functional perspective better, and understand non object oriented work flows.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write and develop this module.

Erlang was used for this module.

# Future Work

* Add an option to search sub-folders as well.
* Implement better formatting in the console.
* Introduce Parent types to search for (Image Files, Text files, Office files, Audio files, etc.)
