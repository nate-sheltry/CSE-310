# Overview

This program in particular focuses on using string manipulation within a class.

The program in this module, the CalculatorApp, was written to learn how to perform string manipulation and basic Kotlin
class structure. It tackles complex arithmetic expressions stored in a string format with the potential of having
parenthesis inside of them.

This program was written to become familiar with Kotlin, a language I have never written in prior to this module.

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ IDEA, and VSCode.

Kotlin programming language.

# Future Work

- Expand Program to work beyond Arithmetic.
- Potentially make non-parenthesis and parenthesis math run in parallel.
- Implement understood multiplication: [6(8+4) = 6*12]
